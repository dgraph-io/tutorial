      <description>Ok, we are off to a start with Dgraph and GraphQL+-. Letâ€™s move it up a few notches.
Dgraph can also do query aggregation, geo-queries, string querying and more. But for all that let&amp;rsquo;s move from the small datasets we started with and try out something bigger, much bigger.
In our github repository you&amp;rsquo;ll find a dataset about movies, directors and actors.
Download it from that link and save into the ~/dgraph directory or by running the following in a terminal</description>

      <description>Dgraph queries, Schema Types and the visualization will help us understand the schema of the movies dataset.
As you&amp;rsquo;ll see in the following pages, we can view the data from a number of perspectives; considering for example directors, movies, genres or even locations as the primary starting point.
Let&amp;rsquo;s have a look from the perspective of directors. Kathryn Bigelow directed the early 90&amp;rsquo;s classic Point Break. We&amp;rsquo;ll begin with her and learn about the schema.</description>
