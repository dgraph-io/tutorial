# A Tour of Dgraph

A step by step introductory tutorial of Dgraph. Built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

Visit https://tour.dgraph.io/ for the running instance.

The tutorial can also be run locally by cloning this repo and running `scripts/local.sh`. The tour
has been tested with hugo `v0.37`.

## Deploying

Run `./scripts/build.sh` in a tmux window. The script polls `dgraph-io/tutorial` every one minute
and pulls any new changes that have been merged to master. It also rebuilds the site if there are
any changes.

If for reason the site is not getting updated after pushing to `master`, the script might have been
terminated. SSH into the server and restart it.
