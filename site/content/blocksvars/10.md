As well as `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `sum` to aggregate, Dgraph supports a host of
functions that can be applied to value variables.  These need to be
enclosed in `math(...)` and stored in a variable.

The full list is:

| Operator                       | Accepted Type  | Notes                                             |
| :------------:                  | :--------------:                               | :------------------------:                                     |
| `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`             | `int` and `float`                                     |                  |
| `min` `max`                     | All types except `geo` and `bool`   |              |
| `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` `!=`     | All, except `geo` and `bool`                     | boolean result                      |
| `floor` `ceil``ln` `exp` `sqrt` | `int` and `float`                     |                         |
| `since`                         | `date`                                 | number of seconds (`float`) from the time specified |
| `pow(a, b)`                     | `int` and `float`                                     |  `a^b`                                     |
| `logbase(a,b)`                  | `int` and `float`                                     |  `log(a)` to the base `b`                               |
| `cond(a, b, c)`                 | `a` must be a boolean                | selects `b` if `a` is true else `c`                            |

Note that these are functions on values, not functions to aggregate value maps.  The results of these functions are value variables and can be aggregated.
