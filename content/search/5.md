Full text search is what Google does for web pages. It's different to term
matching because it tries to respect language, grammar and tense. For example,
matching search term run with documents containing run, running and ran.

It doesn't match terms exactly and instead makes use of

- stemming : finding a common base word so differences in tense, plural/singular
  or other inflection are still matched, and
- stop words : removing words such as and, or, it and maybe that occur too often
  to search over.

Note the difference if `alloftext` is changed to `allofterms`.

<!---Full text search with `alloftext` removes the stop word AAA and matches BBB with BBBing.  While term searching with `allofterms` matches only strings that contain each word in the search.-->
