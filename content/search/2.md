With the `term` index the functions `allofterms` and `anyofterms` find strings that match all of the listed terms or any one of the listed terms.  Previous queries in the tour used these searches.

Try both options and note the difference.

The query makes no further constraints than requiring the found nodes to have a name matching the terms, so actors and directors are returned.
