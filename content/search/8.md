Congratulations on completing the Tour!

You should now be able to load data into Dgraph and perform basic queries and
mutations on it.

### Where to go from here

- Follow the [Tutorial](https://dgraph.io/docs/tutorials/) videos to reinforce
  what you have learnt.
- More queries can be found in the
  [Query Language](https://dgraph.io/docs/query-language/) reference.
- Go to [Clients](https://dgraph.io/docs/clients/) to see how to communicate
  with Dgraph from your application.
- See [Deploy](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy) if you wish to run Dgraph in a
  cluster.
