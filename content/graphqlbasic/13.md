The output graph can rename fields in the output with aliasing.

Aliases are useful when an edge is wanted with two different filters applied. In the example query we have provided for you in the editor, we use aliases to include the friends edge twice both having a unique set of arguments and field selections.

Something to try: Query People and select and alias the `xid` field as 'username' and alias the query as 'users'. Then query all people again filtering for just those with pets and alias as 'peopleWithPets'. See if you can combine these queries into a single operation.

{
  users: queryPerson {
    username: xid
  }
  peopleWithPets: queryPerson(filter: { has: ownsPets }) {
    name
    pet: ownsPets {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
