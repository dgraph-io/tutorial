The `@cascade` directive removes any nodes from query results that don't have
all fields included in the query. You can also use the `@cascade` directive to
remove nodes from query results where a filter inside a block returns no results.

In the following query, Dgraph returns all of Alice's friends, whether or not
they own a pet:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    name
    age
    friends {
      name
      ownsPets {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the `@cascade` directive, friends of Alice that don't own a pet are not
included in the result, as follows:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") @cascade {
    name
    age
    friends {
      name
      ownsPets {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

You can get the same query result more efficiently by using
the `has` filter argument. However, you can't use the `has` argument to return the
desired results in queries that filter on an edge, or with deeper queries.

**Something to try**: Return Alice's friends that own the animal with an `xid` equal
to "goldie".

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    name
    age
    friends @cascade {
      name
      ownsPets(filter: { xid: { eq: "goldie" } }) {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Putting the cascade directive at different levels in the subgraph applies the
cascade effect from that level down.

Compare the responses returned by this query in the following three subgraphs:

```
{
  noCascade: queryPerson {
    id
    name
    age
    friends {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
  cascadeFriends: queryPerson {
    id
    name
    age
    friends @cascade {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
  cascadePeople: queryPerson @cascade {
    id
    name
    age
    friends {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```
