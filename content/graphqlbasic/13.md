The `@cascade` directive removes any nodes that don't have all matching fields
in the query.

Another use is to remove nodes where a filter inside a block returns no results.

In the query below, Dgraph returns all Alice's friends, whether or not they own
a pet.

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    name
    age
    friends {
      name
      ownsPets {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

With the `@cascade` directive, friends of Alice that don't own a pet are not
included in the result.

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") @cascade {
    name
    age
    friends {
      name
      ownsPets {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This exact same result can more efficiently be returned in this example by using
the `has` filter argument. However, in queries that are filtering on an edge or
with deeper queries it is impossible to use the `has` argument to return the
desired results.

Something to try: Return Alice's friends that own the animal with an `xid` equal
to 'goldie'

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    name
    age
    friends @cascade {
      name
      ownsPets(filter: { xid: { eq: "goldie" } }) {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Putting the cascade directive at different levels in the subgraph apply the
cascade effect from that level down.

Compare the responses returned by this query in the three subgraphs.

```
{
  noCascade: queryPerson {
    id
    name
    age
    friends {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
  cascadeFriends: queryPerson {
    id
    name
    age
    friends @cascade {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
  cascadePeople: queryPerson @cascade {
    id
    name
    age
    friends {
      id
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```
