The output graph can rename fields in the output using aliases.

Aliases are useful when you want to apply two different filters to the same edge.
The example query that's provided for you in the editor uses aliases to
include the `friends` edge twice, with a unique set of arguments and field functions
in each case.

**Something to try**: Query `People`, then select and alias the `xid` field as
`username` and alias the query as `users`. Then, query all people again, filtering
for just those with pets, and alias this query as `peopleWithPets`. See if you
can combine these queries into a single operation.

{
  users: queryPerson {
    username: xid
  }
  peopleWithPets: queryPerson(filter: { has: ownsPets }) {
    name
    pet: ownsPets {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
