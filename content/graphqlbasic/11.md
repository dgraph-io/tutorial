The function `has(edge_name)` returns nodes that have an outgoing edge of the
given name.

Dgraph provides the filter argument `has` to find nodes that have an outgoing
edge or predicate value.

In the query example we have provided, we query for all people have have friends
and then return a count of how many friends they have.

Something to try: Query people that have friends and an age and count their
friends that have a set age.

```
{
  queryPerson(filter: { has: friends, and: { has: age } }) {
    id
    name
    age
    friendsAggregate(filter: { has: age }) {
      count
    }
  }
}
```
