The function `has(edge_name)` returns nodes that have an outgoing edge of the
given name.

Dgraph also provides the filter argument `has` to find nodes that have an outgoing
edge or predicate value.

The query example provided here queries for all people who have friends
and then returns a count of how many friends they have.

**Something to try**: Query people that have friends and an age, and then count
their friends that have a set age.

    id
    name
    age
    friendsAggregate(filter: { has: age }) {
      count
    }
  }
}
```
