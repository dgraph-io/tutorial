Nodes are filtered based on functions applied to the node's outgoing edges.

So far the queries have only applied a filter to the top level nodes using the `getPerson` function, but filters can be applied to any edge in the query.

There are many functions for filtering, some of them are

* `fieldName: { allofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: matches nodes with
an outgoing `string` field `fieldName` where the string contains all
listed terms.

* `fieldName: { anyofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: As with `allOfTerms`,
but matches at least one term.

* The equalities and inequalities can be applied to edges of types:
  `Int`, `Int64`, `Float`, `String` and `DateTime`
  * `fieldName: { eq: value }`: equal to
  * `fieldName: { ge: value }`: greater than or equal to
  * `fieldName: { le: value }`: less than or equal to
  * `fieldName: { gt: value }`: greater than
  * `fieldName: { lt: value }`: less than

* There's also regular expressions, full text search and geo search,
  but those are bigger topics that'll have their own section in the tutorial

These filter functions are applied as arguments on fields in the GraphQL syntax. Dgraph will only generate these arguments on fields that have the proper search directive applied for indexing.

Something to try: How about querying all people under the age of 30 along with their pet's name. (Hint: use a filter argument with the `queryPerson` root function.)

Query Alice's friends' pets:

```
{
  queryPerson(filter: { age: { le: 30 } }) {
    id
    name
    ownsPets {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
