Nodes are filtered based on functions applied to the node's outgoing edges.

So far the queries have only applied a filter to the top level nodes using the
`getPerson` function, but filters can be applied to any edge in the query.

There are many functions for filtering, some of them are

- `fieldName: { allofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: matches nodes with an outgoing
  `string` field `fieldName` where the string contains all listed terms.

- `fieldName: { anyofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: As with `allOfTerms`, but
  matches at least one term.

- The equalities and inequalities can be applied to edges of types: `Int`,
  `Int64`, `Float`, `String` and `DateTime`

  - `fieldName: { eq: value }`: equal to
  - `fieldName: { ge: value }`: greater than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { le: value }`: less than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { gt: value }`: greater than
  - `fieldName: { lt: value }`: less than

- There's also regular expressions, full text search and geo search, but those
  are bigger topics that'll have their own section in the tutorial

These filter functions are applied as arguments on fields in the GraphQL syntax.
Dgraph will only generate these arguments on fields that have the proper search
directive applied for indexing.

Something to try: How about querying all people under the age of 30 along with
their pet's name. (Hint: use a filter argument with the `queryPerson` root
function.)

{{% expandable %}} Query Alice's friends' pets:

```
{
  queryPerson(filter: { age: { le: 30 } }) {
    id
    name
    ownsPet {
      id
      name
    }
  }
}
```
