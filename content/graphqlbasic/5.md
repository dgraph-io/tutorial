GraphQL query results are graphs. In fact, the result structure matches the
query structure.

The braces `<edge name> { ... }` in the query signify nested blocks where the
edges inside the block are matched against nodes found by following the edge
that begins the block.

We continue nesting the query as we follow edges from node to node.

While not strictly required, it’s a good style to indent the query.

Compare the JSON result to the structure of the query and note, for example,
that the `friend` edge matched a number of nodes and each is represented in the
JSON.

Something to try: How about Alice’s friends' pets, or Alice's friends' friends.

{{% expandable %}} Query Alice's friends' pets:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      ownsPet {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Query Alice's friends' friends:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      friends {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{{% /expandable %}}

The idea is to formulate the query as a traversal through the graph, following
edges to the desired data. The `id`'s in the JSON output allow interpretation as
a graph rather than a tree. See, for example, the cycles in Alice's friends'
friends.
