GraphQL query results are graphs.  In fact, the result structure matches the query structure.

The braces `<edge name> { ... }` in the query
signify nested blocks where the edges inside the block are matched against nodes found by following the edge that begins the block.

We continue nesting the query as we follow edges from node to node.

While not strictly required, it’s a good style to indent the query.

Compare the JSON result to the structure of the query and note, for example, that the `friend` edge matched a number of nodes and each is represented in the JSON.

Something to try: How about Alice’s friends' pets, or Alice's friends' friends.

Query Alice's friends' pets:

```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      ownsPets {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Query Alice's friends' friends:
```
{
  getPerson(xid: "alice") {
    id
    name
    friends {
      id
      name
      friends {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The idea is to formulate the query as a traversal through the graph, following edges to the desired data. The `id`'s in the JSON output allow interpretation as a graph rather than a tree. See, for example, the cycles in Alice's friends' friends.
