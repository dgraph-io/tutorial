Nodes are filtered based on functions applied to the node's outgoing edges.

So far, the queries have only applied a filter to the top level nodes using the
`getPerson` function, but you can apply filters to any edge in the query.

Dgraph has many functions available for filtering results, including the following:

- `fieldName: { allofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: matches nodes with an outgoing
  `string` field `fieldName` where the string contains all listed terms

- `fieldName: { anyofterms: "term1 ... termN" }`: As with `allOfTerms`, but
  matches at least one term

- The equalities and inequalities can be applied to edges of types: `Int`,
  `Int64`, `Float`, `String` and `DateTime`, including:

  - `fieldName: { eq: value }`: equal to
  - `fieldName: { ge: value }`: greater than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { le: value }`: less than or equal to
  - `fieldName: { gt: value }`: greater than
  - `fieldName: { lt: value }`: less than

In addition to these capabilities, you can filter on regular expressions, use
full text search, or use geographic (geo) search.

These filter functions are applied as arguments on fields in the GraphQL syntax.
Dgraph only generates these arguments on fields that have the proper search
directive applied for indexing.

**Something to try**: You can query all people under the age of 30, along with
the name of their pets. (**Hint**: use a filter argument with the `queryPerson` root
function.)
