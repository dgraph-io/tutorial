It's not uncommon to have thousands of results for a query.

But you might want to select only the top-k answers, paginate the results for
display, or limit a large result.

Dgraph generates `first` and `offset` arguments that can be used in combination
to achieve such limits and pagination results.

- `first: N` Return only the first `N` results
- `offset: N` Skip the first `N` results

By default, query answers are ordered by `uid`. You can change this behavior by
explicitly [specifying an order](/graphql/basic/8).

The `first` and `offset` arguments are available on `query<Type>` queries and on
any edge to a list of nodes.
