You may have notices that Dgraph generates an `<edgeName>Aggregate` edge for
every edge pointing to a list. These aggregate edges along with the aggregate
queries, allow you to count the number of items in a query without the need to
return every node.

These aggregate operations return an aggregate result type generated as
`<type>AggregateResult`. This type provides a unique set of fields for counting
and finding the minimum, maximum,average, and sum values depending on the types
schema.

In the example query we have provided for you, we request every available field
from the `PersonAggregateResult` to return aggregate results from Alice's
friends.

- count - count how many friends Alice has
- xidMin - find the minimum xid value sorted alphabetically
- xidMax - find the maximum xid value sorted alphabetically
- nameMin - find the minimum name value sorted alphabetically
- nameMax - find the maximum name value sorted alphabetically
- ageMin - find the minimum age of Alice's friends
- ageMax - find the maximum age of Alice's friends
- ageAvg - find the average age of Alice's friends
- ageSum - sum of all of the ages of Alice's friends

{{% notice "note" %}} The `<field>Avg` field only averages the values by the
nodes that had a value set. If you have not altered the data from the
Introduction, Alice has 6 friends, but only 4 of them have an age set. The sum
age is 113 and the average age across those 4 nodes is 28.25. {{% /notice %}}

To introspect into the schema for the available fields on the Aggregate edges
and queries, try:

```
{
  __type(name: "<type>AggregateResult") {
    name
    fields {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
