It’s time to talk about data types and scalars.

##### Type System

A GraphQL API is a strictly typed API. Every node is required to have a specific type. There is some magic that the API does for us when adding data by assigning types and filtering types when querying data.

You might have noticed from [Load Data](../../intro/4) that the data in triple format includes a predicate for `<dgraph.type>`. The values from these predicates match the GraphQL type definition of the node. If you load the data using Bulk Loader, Live Loader, or DQL mutations, you will need to set these type predicates if you want the node to be accessible through the GraphQL API.

##### Data types and Schema

There was some magic in the last query because some of the queried
fields returned a value (`name` and `age`), but some were edges to
other nodes (`friend` and `ownsPet`) that themselves had further fields.

The GraphQL schema tells us how to interpret every field. Run the example introspection query and have a look at the JSON result.

There are two kinds of fields in a graph, let’s call them nodes and
values (or literals).  In the example, nodes representing people have
a `name` edge to a `string` value and an `age` edge to an `int` value.  A value can’t have any edges coming out of it.

Here are the types you can use to store values in Dgraph.

| Dgraph Type | Description |
|:------------|:--------|
|  `ID`       | Unique Identifier (UID) |
|  `Int`      | signed 32 bit integer |
|  `Int64`    | signed 64 bit integer |
|  `Float`    | double precision floating-point number |
|  `String`   | string |
|  `Boolean`  | Boolean |
|  `DateTime` | RFC3339 time format with optional timezone like: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999+10:00 or 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999 |
|  `Point`    | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `PointList` | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `Polygon`  | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |
|  `MultiPolygon` | Geolocation types (see [docs](https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/schema/types/#geolocation-types)) |

The schema tells us the Person type has a `friends` field that goes from one nodes of type Person to another node also of type Person, but not to a value.

There's lots more about schema [later in the tutorial](../../schema/1).  For now, though, we know more about the structure of our graph and the types of things in it.
