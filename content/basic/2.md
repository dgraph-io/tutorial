The last query got us some data, but the result wasn’t very interesting, nor was it much to do with graphs.

In Dgraph and GraphQL+-, queries return graphs, not tables or lists of data.

A query is executed against a graph and the result is a subset
of the queried graph, or some manipulation or calculation based
on the queried graph.

Let’s improve the query to get Michael and his network of friends.  

Something to try : Michael also owns a pet, find it and its `name`. The
`owns_pet` edge will help here.

{
  michaels_pet(func: eq(name, "Michael")) {
    name

    friend {
      name@.
    }
    owns_pet {
      name
    }
  }
}
```
