It's not uncommon to have thousands of results for a query.

But you might want to select only the top-k answers, paginate the
results for display, or limit a large result.

In GraphQL+- this is done with `first`, `offset` and `after` in
combination with ordering.


* `first: N` Return only the first `N` results
* `offset: N` Skip the first `N` results
* `after: uid` Return the results after `uid`


By default, query answers are ordered by `uid`. You can change this behavior by
explicitly [specifying an order](/basic/8).

`after` makes sense in pagination when we only know the last `uid` returned and
don't record how many results have previously been retrieved.
