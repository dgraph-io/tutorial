The `@cascade` directive removes any nodes that don't have all matching
edges in the query.

Another use is to remove nodes where a filter inside a block returns
no results.

In the query below, Dgraph returns all Michael's friends, whether or not they own a pet.

```
{
  michael_friends_with_pets(func: allofterms(name@., "Michael")) {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name@.
      owns_pet
    }
  }
}
```

With the `@cascade` directive, friends of Michael that don't own a pet are not included in the result.

```
{
  michael_friends_with_pets(func: allofterms(name@., "Michael")) @cascade {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name@.
      owns_pet
    }
  }
}
```
