The `@cascade` directive removes any nodes that don't have all matching
edges in the query.

Another use is to remove nodes where a filter inside a block returns
no results.

Something to try: By default, in the query below, Dgraph returns all Michael's friends,
and only the friends of friends who are over 27.  Try it with the
`@cascade` directive.

```
{
  michael_friends(func: allofterms(name, "Michael"))  {
    name
    age
    friend {
      name@.
      friend @filter(ge(age, 27)) {
        name@.
        age
      }
    }
  }
}
```
