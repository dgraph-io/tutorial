It’s time to talk about data types and nodes

There was some magic in the last query because some of the queried
edges returned a value (`name` and `age`), but some were edges to
other nodes (`friend` and `owns_pet`) that themselves had further properties.

The truth is that there is a schema to tell us how to interpret an edge.

The visualization won’t be much use this time.  Have a look at the JSON to find out about the schema of the example.

There are two kinds of nodes in a graph, let’s call them nodes and
values (or literals).  In the example, nodes representing people have
a `name` edge to a `string` value and an `age` edge to an `int` value.  A value can’t have any edges coming out of it.

Here are the types you can use to store values in Dgraph.

| Dgraph Type | Description |
|:------------|:--------|
|  `int`      | signed 64 bit integer   |
|  `float`    | double precision floating point number   |
|  `string`   | string  |
|  `bool`     | boolean    |
|  `id`       | ID's stored as strings  |
|  `dateTime` | RFC3339 time format with optional timezone eg: 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999+10:00 or 2006-01-02T15:04:05.999999999    |
|  `geo`      | geometries stored using [go-geom](https://github.com/twpayne/go-geom)    |



There's also the `uid` type, for nodes.  The schema tells us the `friend` edge goes from one node to another, but not to a value.

There's lots more about schema [later in the tutorial](/schema/1).  For now, though, we know more about the structure of our graph and the types of things in it.
