Dgraph supports string text and queries as UTF-8.  

String valued predicates can be annotated with a language tag.  

Amit's name was stored in English `"Amit"@en`, Hindi `"अमित"@hi` and Bengali `"অমিত"@bn`.  Michael's was stored in English.  Artyom's was stored in English and Russian `"Артём"@ru`.  Sang Hyun's was stored in English and Korean `"상현"@ko`.

Queries can search over text in the tagged languages by specifying which language to search and which languages to return.  The syntax `@lang1:...:langN` specifies the preference order for returned languages with the following rules:

* at most one result will be returned
* if results exists in the preferred languages, the left most (in the preference list) of these is returned
* if no result exists in the preferred languages,
  - a result without a language tag is returned, if it exists. If not,
  - any existing language tagged result is returned. If none exist,
  - the edge has no matching result.
