Dgraph supports string text and queries as UTF-8.  

String valued predicates can be annotated with a language tag.  

Amit's name was stored in English `"Amit"@en`, Hindi `"अमित"@hi` and Bengali `"অমিত"@bn`.  Michael's was stored in English.  Artyom's was stored in English and Russian `"Артём"@ru`.  Sang Hyun's was stored in English and Korean `"상현"@ko`.

Queries can search over text in the tagged languages by specifying which language to search and which languages to return.  The syntax `@lang1:...:langN` specifies the preference order for returned languages with the following rules:

* at most one result will be returned
* if results exists in the preferred languages, the left most (in the preference list) of these is returned
* if no result exists in the preferred languages no result is returned unless the preference list is terminated with `.`, in which case the value without a specified language is returned, or if there is no value without language, a value in “some” language is returned.

Try changing `name@ko:ru` to `name@ko:ru:.` to find the missing friend's name.
