  For the following queries to run, you should have loaded data in the [introduction](../../intro/3/).
{{% /notice %}}

Let’s have a look at a hello world query in GraphQL+-.

Every query has a name, and the result is labelled with the same name.

The search criteria `func: ...` matches nodes.  Function `eq` does what you'd expect, matching nodes with a `name` equalling "Michael".  The result is the matched nodes
and listed outgoing edges from those nodes.  

Dgraph identifies each node with a unique internal id, its UID. A UID is not an edge, but can it be returned in a query with `uid`.  If you already know a node's UID, it can be retrieved with `func: uid(<uid-number>)`.

Something to try : Change the query to select someone else.
You can check the [sample data](../../intro/4) again.

{{% expandable %}}
Find a name in the data and try
```
{
  find_someone(func: eq(name, "...name in here...")) {
    name
    age
  }
}
```
Or look at the `UID`s in the data and try
```
{
  find_someone(func: uid(...uid number here...)) {
    name
    age
  }
}
```
You can edit the queries and try whatever you like.  When there are
answers like this, cut and paste them into the query panel, then edit and
run them.

The tutorial will handle the running of the query for you, so
just focus on the query text.  You can also learn about [posting
queries](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#step-3-run-queries) or [programming with Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/clients/).
