Ok, we are off to a start with Dgraph and GraphQL+-.  Let’s move it up
a few notches.

Dgraph can also do query aggregation, geo-queries, string querying and more.  But for all that let's move from the small datasets we started with and try out something bigger, much bigger.

In our github repository you'll find a [dataset about movies, directors
and actors](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/goldendata.rdf.gz).  

Download it from that link or with something like

```
wget "https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/goldendata.rdf.gz?raw=true" -O goldendata.rdf.gz -q
```

Run the schema mutation and then load the dataset into Dgraph with

```
dgraph-live-loader -r goldendata.rdf.gz
```

Dgraph reports back exactly how many triples were loaded and how long
it took.  There are around ??? movies and ???
actors are described in the dataset.

It's a big database of moves, but it won’t trouble Dgraph.  It is, however, big enough to
use for more complex queries.

Later in the tutorial, you might need to refer back to this page (or
issue a [schema query](/basic/3)) to check the indexes or schema types.  Remember that
we can't apply functions to edges that aren't indexed, and some
functions require particular indexes.
