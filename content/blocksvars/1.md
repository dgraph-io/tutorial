Queries can be issued as multiples.

For queries labelled `q1, ..., qn` issued as a multiple query block, the JSON
result will contain labelled answer blocks `q1, ..., qn` for each query.

If a block is labelled with `var`, no results are returned for that
query.

Queries issued in this way are independent.

The visualization here finds the union in the two queries based on
`uid`, but the JSON result contains the independent answer for each query.

So, In this case, we are visualizing the union between two distinct
queries.

Query variables are one of the most powerful features of  GraphQL+-.
Query variables allow the answers from one block to be
used in another, joining the two queries.  You'll learn about query variables in the following pages.
