Summation `sum` and average `avg` can only be applied to value variables that
contain `int` and `float` data.

Find which is greater, the number of movies by Steven Spielberg or the
average number of actors in movies directed by him.

This query can be done in a single block, but you'll see here how values are available in other blocks if the corresponding UID's are available for the value map.

Spoiler alert:
{{% expandable %}}
```
{
  ID as var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Steven Spielberg")) {
    director.film {
      num_actors as count(starring)
    }
    average as avg(val(num_actors))
  }

  avs(func: uid(ID)) @normalize {
    name : name@en
    average_actors : val(average)
    num_films : count(director.film)
  }
}
```
{{% /expandable %}}

After you have the query working, try changing the second block to use the wrong UID's and see what happens.  For example, change `avs` to query for a different director instead of using `ID` - the definition of variable `ID` would also need to be removed, otherwise it would be defined but not used.
