Results can be stored in variables and used elsewhere in the query.

Variables are declared by

```
var_name as some_block { ... }
```

where `var_name` is any distinct variable name and `some_block` is
either a whole query or an internal block of a query matching on an edge.

Once defined, variables can be used in:

* the same query in a child of the defining block (not a parent of the
definition)
* in another query

Variables don't affect the semantics of the query at the point they
are defined.

Query variables are used by `uid(<variable-name>)`.  Variables evaluate to all `uid`'s matched in the query by the block they are
defined against.  In particular, note that, variables are `uid` lists, not the graph
matched by the block, and that the variable evaluates to all `uid`'s the block matches for the whole query, not the `uid`'s matched by any one branch.

It is an error to define a variable but not use it.

Let's look at the options for query variables in turn.
