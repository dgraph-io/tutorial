As well as `min`, `max`, `avg`, and `sum` to aggregate, Dgraph supports a host of
functions that can be applied to value variables.  These need to be
enclosed in `math(...)` and stored in a variable.

The full list is:

| Operator                         | Accepted Type                       | Notes                                               |
| :------------------------------: | :---------------------------------: | :-------------------------------------------------: |
| `+` `-` `*` `/` `%`              | `int` and `float`                   |                                                     |
| `min` `max`                      | All types except `geo` and `bool`   |                                                     |
| `<` `>` `<=` `>=` `==` `!=`      | All, except `geo` and `bool`        | boolean result                                      |
| `floor` `ceil` `ln` `exp` `sqrt` | `int` and `float`                   |                                                     |
| `since`                          | `date`                              | number of seconds (`float`) from the time specified |
| `pow(a, b)`                      | `int` and `float`                   |  `a^b`                                              |
| `logbase(a,b)`                   | `int` and `float`                   |  `log(a)` to the base `b`                           |
| `cond(a, b, c)`                  | `a` must be a boolean               | selects `b` if `a` is true else `c`                 |

Note that these are functions on values, not functions to aggregate value maps.  The results of these functions are value variables and can be aggregated.
