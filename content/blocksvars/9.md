If the context provided by the UIDs of the block is correct, value variables can also be used in filtering and ordering.

Here, `ID` will be the UID's of all directors of name Steven and `average` is a map from those UID's to the average for each director.  The filtering, ordering and result for `var(average)` are evaluated in that context to obtain each value.

A value variable can be used in place of a UID variable, `uid(<value-variable>)` evaluates to the UID's in the map.  For example, the `avs` query block could be written:
```
avs(func: uid(average), orderdesc: val(average)) @filter(ge(val(average), 40)) @normalize {
```
