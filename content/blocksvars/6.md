We've seen two common uses for variables: filtering and reorganizing results.  Another is linking two queries to gain some new insight based on the joined results.

Let's look at an example of joining two queries.

For two directors find the actors who have worked with both (not
necessarily on the same movie).  Many directors won't have actors in
common, so start with some you are sure will (the answer below uses
Peter Jackson and Martin Scorsese who have a small number of actors in
common).

As an optional challenge, for each
of those actors list the movies they have made with either director.

```
{
  var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Peter Jackson")) {
    F_PJ as director.film {
      starring{
        A_PJ as performance.actor
      }
    }
  }

   var(func: allofterms(name@en, "Martin Scorsese")) {
    F_MS as director.film {
      starring{
        A_MS as performance.actor
      }
    }
  }

  actors(func: uid(A_PJ)) @filter(uid(A_MS)) @cascade {
    actor: name@en
    actor.film {
      performance.film @filter (uid(F_PJ, F_MS)) {
      	name@en
      }
    }
  }
}
```  
The syntax `uid(F_PJ, F_MS)` means the UIDs in either `F_PJ` or `F_MS` and is equivalent to `uid(F_PJ) OR uid(F_MS)`.
