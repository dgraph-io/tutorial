We've added a new schema and loaded some company data, but what about integrating our previous friends dataset with the company extension?

If we try to reference an existing company by name only given our current schema, we will instead create a new Company node as we saw in a previous lesson.

The generated GraphQL API does make it very easy to search for a node to update, and update the node linking to existing or new nodes.

Because the UID for Company nodes, mapped to the `id` field, are generated dynamically by Dgraph, these `id`'s may not be the same across every backend being used in this tutorial.

We have provided an example mutation that searches for nodes of the type Person by their xid and updates those nodes by setting edges to existing people, new people, and a new company.

The update mutation can do bulk update on nodes by widening the filter parameters.

The returned payload provides the `numUids` field that is a count of how many nodes were created or updated. The payload also returns the nodes that were filtered for the update. Field selection on these nodes show the nodes in the state after they were updated.

Since nodes can be updated and linked to pre-existing nodes, it is possible to traverse these pre-existing nodes to find other nodes that were not provided in the update input.

A mutation can set predicate values in similar fashion as it sets edges.

Something to try. Update the newly created person with `xid` equal to "karl" and set the age to "42".

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: {
      # your filter(s) here
      xid: { eq: "karl" }
    }
    set: { 
      # edges and predicates to add/update here
      age: 42
    }
  }) {
    numUids #this is the number of new nodes updated or created
    person {
      # field selection here
      xid
      age
    }
  }
}
```

A Challenge to try. The mutation we provided set Alice as the manager of Frank and Karl and set Alice's manager as Bob, but it did not link Bob, Frank, or Karl to the employer "Acme Corp." Update Acme Corp's employees to include Bob, Frank, and Karl.

Update Acme Corp's employees:
mutation {
  updateCompany(input: {
    filter: { name: { eq: "Acme Corp." } }
    set: { employees: [
      { xid: "bob" }
      { xid: "frank" }
      { xid: "karl" }
    ] }
  }) {
    numUids
    company {
      id
      name
      employees {
        xid
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
