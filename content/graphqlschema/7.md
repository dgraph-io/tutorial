Dgraph's generated GraphQL API also provides mutations to delete data from the
graph. Data can be deleted in the following ways:

- Update nodes and remove edges
- Update nodes and remove predicate values
- Delete a node with all of its inbound and outbound edges and predicate values.

To remove an edge from a node, you will need to use the same update mutation
pattern that you saw in the previous lesson. Except this time,  instead of using
the `set` argument, you use the `remove` argument.

The following example query removes the "manages" and "manager" edges between Alice and Frank:

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: { xid: { eq: "alice" } }
    remove: { manages: [{ xid: "frank" }] }
  }) {
    person {
      xid
      manages {
        xid
      }
    }
  }
}
```

{{% notice "note" %}} The `update<type>` mutations let you set or remove
multiple edges and values in a single operation. {{% /notice %}}

The example mutation shown above removes edges between two specific nodes. It's
also possible to remove edges from one node to all other nodes. The following
mutation example removes all nodes from the "manages" edge from Alice.

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: { xid: { eq: "alice" } }
    remove: { manages: null }
  })
}
```

Dgraph keeps the deletion of edges balanced (inclusive of both directions) when
the `@hasInverse` directive is applied, just like it keeps edges balanced when
creating them. 

To delete predicate values, the syntax is very similar to the above. Instead of
listing the edges to remove we can provide the value to remove. If the value is
set to null, then all values are removed for that predicate.

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: { xid: { eq: "alice" } }
    remove: { age: null }
  }) {
    person {
      xid
      age
    }
  }
}
```

To delete a node with all of its predicate values, along with the inbound and
outbound edges, we need to use the `delete<type>` mutation, as follows:

```
mutation {
  deletePerson(filter: {
    xid: "karl"
  }) {
    person {
      xid
      name
      age
    }
  }
}
```

The state of the nodes returned is the representation of the node before the
deletion was applied, so the return value provides a final record of that data.

{{% notice "note" %}} When a node is deleted from Dgraph, the xid can be reused,
but the GraphQL API will not allow the UID to be reused because all UIDs are set
out of the control to the GraphQL API. It is possible to reuse UIDs if the
GraphQL is bypassed and mutations are made from other endpoints. {{% /notice %}}
