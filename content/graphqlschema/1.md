As we saw in an [earlier lesson](../../graphqlbasic/3/), Dgraph accepts a GraphQL schema comprised of types to generate the GraphQL API.

The GraphQL API is a strictly typed API. You can only add and query data that matches a predefined schema. However, do not let this limitation restrict you from iterating upon the schema as needed.

Normally in GraphQL implementations you would have to define inputs, queries, and mutations in the GraphQL schema being deployed. Dgraph generates all of these for you. All you have to do is to define your types.

In order for Dgraph to correctly generate the correct GraphQL API, the complete GraphQL schema needs to be supplied on every schema update. This does not mean that we need to provide the inputs, queries, and mutations, but it means that if we leave off a type on a schema update, then that part of the API will cease to exist even though the underlying data remains unchanged.

In the schema we provide to you as an example, we have iterated upon our previous schema and have included the type Company and added additional fields on the type Person. Continuing we will discuss the specifics of these schema changes.

Push this new schema to the server and continue to the next step.
