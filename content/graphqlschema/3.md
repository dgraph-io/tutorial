In the previous lesson we mentioned that a Company did not have a unique
identifier and therefore could not be queries individually `getCompany` or
reference uniquely to create edges to pre-existing nodes.

While this statement was true from the GraphQL API perspective, every node does
have a unique identifier (UID) even if it is not mapped to a field withing the
GraphQL schema using the ID scalar.

Another change we are making to the schema here is adding a `hash` based search
directive to the Company's name, and expanding the search directive on the
Company's industry to be both `hash` and `term` based.

After pushing this change, any companies queried will then have the `id` field
available for selection which will already be populated with the node's UID.

It can be of importance to note, that every node within a graph has a unique
identifier (UID). This prevents any two nodes from having the same UID even if
they are of different types.

Something to try : Go back to the previous lesson for a query runner, and try to
query the Company's ids.

```
{
  queryCompany {
    id
    name
    industry
    managers: employees(filter: { has: manages }) {
      id
      name
      employees: manages {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

For a bigger challenge : Go back to the previous lesson for a query runner, and
try to mutate Alice (xid: "alice") and update the Person to link to an existing
Company as her employer.

{{% expandable %}}

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: { xid: { eq: "alice" } }
    set: { employers: [{ id: "<UID here>" }] }
  }) {
    person {
      xid
      name
      employers {
        id
        name
        employees {
          name
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Interestingly to note is that if you use the id of a Company with existing
employees, the response of the above mutation will return all of the employees
and not just Alice. {{% /expandable %}}
