Congratulations on completing the schema module.

The Dgraph instance you have running for the tutorial and the lessons in the
modules so far give you a sandbox to play in. Make whatever queries or changes
you like until you are comfortable with the material covered so far.

When you're done, let's move on to learning about the search capabilities of 
Dgraph's generated GraphQL API. Then, you can delve into some larger datasets with
GraphQL before taking a look at DQL, Dgraph's query language.
