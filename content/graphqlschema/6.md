Now that we have seen the schema for inverse relationships in the previous
lesson, let's do some queries around the data that we have so far in our
database.

With balanced inverse relationships we can query what company a person works for
and also query what employees work at a company.

Having a graph that flows in both directions, a multitude of applications can be
developed that endlessly flow through these edges.

In this query we want to know who works for "Company ABC" without having to add
extra edges. In the same operation we are also getting a single person, Jack,
and getting his employers.

The power of inverse relationships may not be very evident with our small
dataset. Imagine a large dataset where you have thousands of people and
thousands of companies. If relationships were only setup in one direction then
it would be very inefficient to query a specific node through many nodes.

Having understood the above statement, you can understand why using the
`@cascade` directive on a query is not always the most efficient method. The
following queries return the same nodes as the query in the editor, but does so
inefficiently using cascade. Remember cascade is a post query process done
before the results are returned, causing all of the nodes to be read by the
query even if they are removed from the response.

```
{
  queryPerson @cascade(fields:["employers"]) {
    xid
    name
    employers(filter: { name: { eq: "CompanyABC" } }) @cascade(fields:["id"]) {
      id
      name
    }
  }
  queryCompany @cascade(fields:["employees"]) {
    id
    name
    employees @cascade(fields:["xid"]) {
      xid
      name
    }
  }
}
```

The query operation above uses the parameterized cascade syntax to require only
specific fields.
