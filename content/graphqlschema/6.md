We've added a new schema and loaded some company data, but what about
integrating our previous friends dataset with the company extension?

If we try to reference an existing company by name only given our current
schema, we will instead create a new Company node as we saw in a previous
lesson.

The generated GraphQL API does make it very easy to search for a node to update,
and update the node linking to existing or new nodes.

Because the UID for Company nodes, mapped to the `id` field, are generated
dynamically by Dgraph, these `id`'s may not be the same across every backend
being used in this tutorial.

We have provided an example mutation that searches for nodes of the type Person
by their xid and updates those nodes by setting edges to existing people, new
people, and a new company.

The update mutation can do bulk update on nodes by widening the filter
parameters.

The returned payload provides the `numUids` field that is a count of how many
nodes were created or updated. The payload also returns the nodes that were
filtered for the update. Field selection on these nodes show the nodes in the
state after they were updated.

Since nodes can be updated and linked to pre-existing nodes, it is possible to
traverse these pre-existing nodes to find other nodes that were not provided in
the update input.

A mutation can set predicate values in similar fashion as it sets edges.

Something to try. Update the newly created person with `xid` equal to "karl" and
set the age to "42".

```
mutation {
  updatePerson(input: {
    filter: {
      # your filter(s) here
      xid: { eq: "karl" }
    }
    set: {
      # edges and predicates to add/update here
      age: 42
    }
  }) {
    numUids #this is the number of new nodes updated or created
    person {
      # field selection here
      xid
      age
    }
  }
}
```

A Challenge to try. The mutation we provided set Alice as the manager of Frank
and Karl and set Alice's manager as Bob, but it did not link Bob, Frank, or Karl
to the employer "Acme Corp." Update Acme Corp's employees to include Bob, Frank,
and Karl.

{{% expandable %}} Update Acme Corp's employees: mutation { updateCompany(input:
{ filter: { name: { eq: "Acme Corp." } } set: { employees: [ { xid: "bob" } {
xid: "frank" } { xid: "karl" } ] } }) { numUids company { id name employees {
xid name } } } } {{% /expandable %}}
