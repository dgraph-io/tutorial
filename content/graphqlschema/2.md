Now that the schema has been updated in the previous step we use the new mutations to add data.

Making changes to the graph stored in Dgraph is called mutating the data.

If you had a large amount of data to load after updating the GraphQL schema, it might be better to use the Live Loader and add the data as RDF triples. Refer to the previous lesson [Intro - Load Data](../../graphqlintro/4) to see an example of GraphQL data mapped to RDF Triples.

You may notice if we go much further that we have defined no way to uniquely identify a company. You can query for Companies and even filter based upon their industry:

```
{
  queryCompany(filter: { industry: { anyofterms: "Machinery Tech" } }) {
    name
    industry
    managers: employees(filter: { has: manages }) {
      id
      name
      employees: manages {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Since we did not define a unique identifier for the Company type, Dgraph did not generate the `getCompany` query for us. Also you may notice that if you try to run the original mutation again to add companies, that duplicate companies will be created, but not duplicat people since `xid` is a unique identifier.

Also without having a unique identifier for a Company, it is impossible to update a Person and set their employer referencing a pre-existing Company.
