Dgraph at its core is a loosely-typed database, and can be used in a NoSQL-like
schema-less fashion. GraphQL provides a strongly typed API that is served from
the core of a Dgraph database instance.

All other GraphQL databases apply GraphQL as a layer served above the database,
but starting with Dgraph 20.03, Dgraph brings GraphQL into the core of the
database itself. Dgraph was developed around DQL's GraphQL-like syntax, so
integrating native GraphQL was a natural fit.

GraphQL provides an API that is:

- Strongly typed
- Simple to query
- Easy to traverse
- Flexible to iterate upon
- Proficient with business logic
- Capable of 3rd-party data integration

The GraphQL API provides an endpoint to ask for exactly what you want and
provides results that match the shape of your request.
