A graph database is a database optimized for storing and querying graphs. When it comes to relationships, graph databases are much faster than SQL databases.

SQL databases get bogged down by graph-like data because following edges means joining tables; sometimes big tables. And, the more edges, the more joins, and the more data needs to be loaded and processed.

In a graph database, the edges are a fundamental structure, so following edges occurs in a single lookup making edge-based operations blazingly fast.

Dgraph is a graph database that's optimized to store graph data and to query it quickly. And, it is horizontally-scalable so it can manage lots of transactions against very large graphs.

With Dgraph, you can store a graph on a single computer with millions of edges, or you can store massive graphs that require a whole data center to process.
