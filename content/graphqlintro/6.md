So far in this tour, you have deployed a Dgraph database and run a few mutations
to edit data. But before proceeding further, you'd like to understand some
basics, like: What is a graph, and what does it have to do with databases?

Graphs describe objects and the interconnections between them. You may have
heard of friendship graphs, or a social network graph, where data points
(people) are connected together through known relationships.

Press **Run** on the query to the right.

Graphs aren't just for social networks, other examples include:

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Network, like computers, roads, telecommunications
- Processes, like business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets
- Modeling of Geographic or 3D objects

These and the many more applications of graphs make them a natural choice for
databases.
