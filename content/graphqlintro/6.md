So far in this tour, you have deployed a Dgraph database and run a few mutations
to edit data. But before proceeding further, you'd like to understand some
basics, like: What is a graph, and what does it have to do with databases?

Graphs describe objects and the interconnections between them. You may have
heard of friendship graphs, or a social network graph, where data points
(people) are connected together through known relationships.

Press **Run** on the query to the right. In the resulting graph, circles denote
nodes (people and animals) and lines denote connections or labeled relationships
between these people and animals.

Graphs lend themselves so naturally to visualizations that you'll find yourself
thinking in terms of graphs and visualizations of graphs.

Graphs aren't just for social networks, other examples include:

- Interconnected data, like SQL tables requiring joins
- Advanced search
- Recommendation engines
- Network, like computers, roads, telecommunications
- Processes, like business and biological processes
- Events and the causality or other links between them
- Structures of firms or markets
- Modeling of Geographic or 3D objects

These and the many more applications of graphs make them a natural choice for
databases.
