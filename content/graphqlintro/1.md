Welcome to GraphQL powered by [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io) database.

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running writing queries in GraphQL
using Dgraph Cloud, a Dgraph database backend that we offer as a managed
service.

{{% notice "note" %}} To take a tour of Dgraph using Dgraph Query Language (DQL,
formerly known as GraphQL+-), please see the [DQL-focused portion of this
tour]({{< relref "intro/1" >}}). The first five sections of this tour focus
exclusively on using Dgraph Cloud with GraphQL. {{% /notice %}}

In this tutorial, you can run queries and mutations. The tutorial will guide you
from your first graph query to creating more advanced queries.

After completing this self-contained tutorial, please see the reference material
available to help you use Dgraph in the [Dgraph Docs](https://docs.dgraph.io),
and on [Dgraph Learn](https://dgraph.io/learn).

When you are ready to begin, click the **Next** button.
