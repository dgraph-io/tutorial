You can load data into a Dgraph database with GraphQL mutations.

To load the small dataset that we have provided for your use in the upcoming
lessons, run the mutations that we have provided by clicking **Run**.

For the consistency of mutations and queries in this tutorial we use an `xid`
field to identify nodes. We could have not used the `xid` field and relied
solely upon the `id` field with the scalar type `ID`, but assigned `ids` will
vary across instances.
