Full text search is what Google does for web pages. It's different than term
matching because it factors in language, grammar, and tense. For example,
matching search word "run" with documents containing "run", "running" and "ran".

Full text search does not match terms exactly and instead makes use of

- stemming : finding a common base word so differences in tense, plural/singular
  or other inflection are still matched, and
- stop words : removing words such as and, or, it and maybe that occur too often
  to search over.

Change `alloftext` to `allofterms` and note the difference in results returned.
