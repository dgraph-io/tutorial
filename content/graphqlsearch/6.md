Full text search is what Google and other search engines do for web pages. It's
different than term matching because it factors in language, grammar, and tense.
For example, you will see matches on the search keyword "run" with documents 
that contain very common strings like "run", "running" and "ran".

Full text search does not match terms exactly, but instead makes use of the
following techniques:

- **Stemming**: finding a common base word so differences in tense, plural/singular
  or other inflection don't prevent a match, and
- **Stop words**: removing common words such as "and", "or", "it"; along with
 some additional words that occur too often.

Change `alloftext` to `allofterms` and note the difference in the results returned.
