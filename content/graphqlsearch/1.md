When Dgraph searches for strings, dates, or other values based on a filter,
it needs an index to make the search efficient. We've already seen examples of
how to specify the indexes in a [schema update](../../graphqlschema/3).

`Int`, `Float`, and `DateTime` have default indexes, but `String` has a few
options for which search index types to use. You can build multiple indexes
for the same `String`-valued predicate.

For `String`, the following indexes are available:

- `term`: Used when filtering by "all terms" or by "any terms"; generates filter
   inputs `allofterms` and `anyofterms`
- `exact`: for use with inequality, matches a whole string and generates the
   following filter inputs: `lt` (<), `le` (<=), `eq` (=), `ge` (>=), `gt` (>),
   and `in` (not equal)
- `hash`: Used similarly to `exact`, but hashes the string to accommodate longer
   strings; generates the following filter inputs: `eq` (equal) and `in` (not equal)
- `fulltext`: Used for full-text search-engine style search; generates the following
   filter inputs `alloftext` and `anyoftext`
- `regexp`: Used with regular expression searches; generates the `regexp` filter
   input

You specify multiple indexes as a list passed to the `by` argument of the
`@search` directive.

Apply the schema mutation to apply the new indexes and types on your database.
It may take a minute for Dgraph to compute these new indexes if working with a
larger data graph. Let the schema push operation run, and then move on after it's
finished.
