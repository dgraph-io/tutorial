Dgraph doesn't support directly setting the IDs of nodes.  If an application requires unique identifiers for nodes other than the UID assigned by Dgraph, then these are supplied as edges.  It's up to a user application to ensure the uniqueness of such IDs/keys.

In RDF, Linked Open Data uses URIs to identify nodes.  See the [Dgraph docs](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/#external-ids) for more information on how these are handled in Dgraph.
