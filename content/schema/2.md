Now that the schema has been updated we can add data as triples.

Dgraph creates its own internal id’s for nodes, but we need some way to refer to the same node many times in our input data.  That’s what `_:company1` does.  

Technically, these are ‘blank nodes’.  They tell Dgraph to create a node, give it an internal id and make sure it’s used consistently.  

After the upload, the label `_:company1` doesn’t exist in
Dgraph and we can’t query for it.  You’ll see in the result that
Dgraph has replaced it with an internal id.  You can query for this
internal id --- remember `func: uid(<uid_number>)`.

Making changes to the graph stored in Dgraph is called mutating the
data.
