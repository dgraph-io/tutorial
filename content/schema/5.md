Edges are directional.  A query can't traverse an edge in
reverse.

There are two choices to query in both directions

* Add the reverse edge to the schema and add all the reverse edge data.

* Tell Dgraph to always store the reverse edge using the `@reverse` keyword in the schema.

Run the schema mutation and Dgraph will compute all the reverse edges.
 The reverse edge of `an_edge` is `~an_edge`.

In terms of data modeling, some reverse edges always make sense, like `boss_of`, others like ,`friend`, are sometimes, but not always bidirectional.
