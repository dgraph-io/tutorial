As we saw in an [earlier lesson](/basic/3/), Dgraph stores a schema describing the types of predicates.

When we want to add new data to an existing schema, we can just add it.  But if we want to add new data in a new schema we have two choices

* Add the data and let Dgraph work out the schema, or
* Specify a schema and then add the data

Dgraph can work out the schema just fine.  But functions and filtering
can only be applied to indexed predicates and for that we need to specify the schema.

Making changes to the schema is called mutating the schema.

Run the schema mutation.  The index allows applying filter functions,
such as searching for all companies that participate in a particular
industry.
