There are four deletion options inside a delete mutation.

* `uid <edge> uid/value .`  Delete a single triple
* `uid <edge> * .`  Delete all triples for a given edge
*  `uid * * .` Delete all triples for a given node
* `* <edge> *` Delete all data for an edge.

Again, we can't give you the complete example: the `uid`'s will be unique to
your instance.  Try something out; you're not going to hurt
anyone, just delete their friends.
