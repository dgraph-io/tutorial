There are three deletion options inside a delete mutation.

* `<uid> <edge> <uid>/"value" .`  Delete a single triple
* `<uid> <edge> * .`  Delete all triples for a given edge
*  `<uid> * * .` Delete all triples for a given node

{{% notice "note" %}}
  In order to delete with `S * *` pattern. You need to have a Type related to the node itself. See: [Type System](https://docs.dgraph.io/master/query-language/#type-system)
{{% /notice %}}

The examples given here are not complete. Uids assigned on your
instance would be unique. Try something out; you're not going
to hurt anyone, just delete their friends.

You can do the same example using JSON format. You're able to do that through our clients, cURL or Ratel UI.

#### See in JSON:

Delete all triples for a given node

```JSON
 {
        "delete": [
            {
                "uid": "0xa"
            }
        ]
    }
```

Delete all triples for a given edge

```JSON
 {
        "delete": [
            {
                "uid": "0xa",
                "friends": null
            }
        ]
    }
```
>This doesn't delete their children which means in this case, it will not erase the "friends". Only the relation would be deleted.

Deleting relations and then their children

```JSON
 {
        "delete": [
            {
                "uid": "0x2", # Answer UID.
                "comment": {
                   "uid": "0x3" # Delete relation (edge) with the Comment
            }
            },
            {
                "uid": "0x3" # Delete the actual comment
            }
        ]
    }
```
