There are three deletion options inside a delete mutation.

* `<uid> <edge> <uid>/"value" .`  Delete a single triple
* `<uid> <edge> * .`  Delete all triples for a given edge
*  `<uid> * * .` Delete all triples for a given node

The examples given here are not complete. Uids assigned on your
instance would be unique. Try something out; you're not going
to hurt anyone, just delete their friends.
