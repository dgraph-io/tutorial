We've added a new schema and loaded some company data, but what about
integrating our previous friends dataset with this company one.

Loading a new dataset links nodes with `_:tempname`, but existing
nodes have a `uid` in Dgraph unrelated to the blank node used for
loading.  To assert new triples about existing
nodes is to add a triples involving the existing `uid`.

Because the `uid` picked by Dgraph is unique, we can't help you this
time.  Use the `uid`'s picked by your instance of Dgraph to  write a mutation that links the company and
friendship data.  Hint: previous queries will tell you the `uid`.

The process you've just done here would normally done
programmatically - query the data to get the `uid`'s, formulate the
mutations, then batch  the updates.
