A graph database is a database optimized for storing and querying graphs.  When it comes to relationships, graph databases are much faster than SQL databases.

SQL databases get bogged down by graph-like data because following
edges means joining tables; sometimes big tables; the more edges, the
more joins, and the more data needs to be loaded and processed.

In a graph database, the edges are a fundamental structure, so following edges is a single lookup,
making this operation blazingly fast.

**Dgraph is a graph database.**  It’s optimized to store graph data and to query it fast.  More than that, it’s designed to scale to huge graphs across many machines.

With Dgraph, you can store a graph on a single computer with millions of edges, or you can store massive graphs that require a whole data centre to process.
