Hi,

Welcome to [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io).

<!---
Dgraph is a distributed graph database, designed to scale from a single machine to data centers.

Before using Dgraph in your own projects, you’ll need to know about
graph databases and how to query Dgraph.
-->

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running with Dgraph and writing
graph queries in Dgraph Query Language [DQL](https://docs.dgraph.io/dql).


The tutorial is divided into modules. You can access the table of contents at
any time by clicking on the context menu ("sandwich" icon) in the bottom left corner
of the screen; you can also navigate using the **Back** and **Next** buttons
at the bottom of this pane, or by pressing your keyboard's
**Left Arrow** (&#8592;) and **Right Arrow** (&#8594;) keys.

In this tutorial, you can run and edit the queries and interact with the
visualizations.

The tutorial will guide you from your first graph query to queries a graph
expert would be proud of.

As well as this self contained tutorial, there’s lots of
[reference material](https://dgraph.io/docs/) to help you use Dgraph.

When you are ready to begin click **Next**.
