Hi,

Welcome to [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io).

<!---
Dgraph is a distributed graph database, designed to scale from a single machine to data centers.

Before using Dgraph in your own projects, you’ll need to know about
graph databases and how to query Dgraph.
-->

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running with Dgraph and writing
graph queries in [DQL](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/), Dgraph's own
graph query language.

{{% notice "note" %}} If you are looking for GraphQL Spec support, please start
at https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/overview/ this tutorial is exclusive for DQL
(GraphQL+-). {{% /notice %}}

The tutorial is divided into modules. You can access the table of contents at
any time by clicking on the hamburger icon in the bottom left and can move backwards
and forwards using the **Back** and **Next** buttons at the bottom of this pane, or
by pressing the <kbd>Left Arrow</kbd> and <kbd>Right Arrow</kbd> keys of your
keyboard.

In this tutorial, you can run and edit the queries and interact with the
visualizations.

The tutorial will guide you from your first graph query to queries a graph
expert would be proud of.

As well as this self contained tutorial, there’s lots of
[reference material](https://dgraph.io/docs/) to help you use Dgraph.

When you are ready to begin click **Next**.
