Hi,

Welcome to [Dgraph](https://dgraph.io).

<!---
Dgraph is a distributed graph database, designed to scale from a single machine to data centers.

Before using Dgraph in your own projects, you’ll need to know about
graph databases and how to query Dgraph.
-->

This interactive tutorial will get you up and running with Dgraph and writing graph

queries in [DQL](https://docs.dgraph.io/query-language/), Dgraph's own graph query language.

  If you are looking for GraphQL Spec support, please start at https://dgraph.io/docs/graphql/overview/ this tutorial is exclusive for DQL (GraphQL+-).

The tutorial is divided into modules. You can access the table of
contents at any time by clicking "A Tour of Dgraph" in the top left and can move backwards
and forwards using the right and left arrows at the bottom of this pane.

In this tutorial, you can run and edit the queries and interact with the visualizations.

The tutorial will guide you from your first graph query to queries a graph expert would be proud of.

As well as this self contained tutorial, there’s lots of
[reference material](https://dgraph.io/docs/) to help you use Dgraph.

When you are ready to begin click the right arrow.
