Once you have Dgraph up and running, press **run** on the panel to the right.
This will load a schema into Dgraph for us to use in the first steps of the
tutorial. Don't worry too much about the syntax for now, we'll cover all that
in later lessons, just check in the response panel that the operation was a
success.

Note that, as we just installed it, Dgraph won't be persisting any
data.  If you want to persist the data after you stop the Dgraph
server, use the `-v` flag as [shown here](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#using-docker).
