Once you have Dgraph up and running, press **run** on the panel to the
right.  This will load a simple dataset into Dgraph for us to use in
the first steps of the tutorial.  Don't worry too much about the
syntax for now, we'll cover all that in later lessons, just check in
the response panel that the operation was a success.

Note that, as we just installed it, Dgraph won't be persisting any
data.  If you want to persist the data after you stop the Dgraph
server, use the `-v` flag as [shown here](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#using-docker).
