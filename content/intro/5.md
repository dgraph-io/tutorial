Adding or removing data in Dgraph is called a mutation. We have two types of standards for Mutations. RDF (Resource Description Framework) N-Quad and JSON (Self explaned). RDF is a widely used standard in Graph or Ontology systems.

In Dgraph the Mutation operations consist of two patterns. Explicit or "incognito". Where when using Blank Nodes marks, you are defining non-relational writing, meaning that you want a New Node. And when it explicitly writes the UID of an existing Node. You are relating that new data to that UID of an existing node.

This introduction is important for the coming exercises, many of the concepts presented here will be repeated in the next few chapters.

e.g: [Adding Data - mutating data](https://tour.dgraph.io/schema/2/) and [Exercise : Integrating existing data](https://tour.dgraph.io/schema/6/)

## Blank Nodes

In Dgraph's Syntax of both JSON and RDF, any definition that escapes from the UID standard can be considered Blank Node. The structure of the Blank node consists of:

underline + a colon + unique name (identifier)

This is the correct Blank Node syntax. However, there will be cases that the parser will consider some typo as Blank Node. But its use is not recommended (). Examples below:

```
<_:uid43> or <_:uid4e030f>
<someTypoMistake>
```
> Export Dgraph's operation uses Blank Nodes of the first form presented. But do not worry. Not recommended for users only.

In JSON is almost the same logic. But you gonna use the "uid" atribute in JSON object to define the Blank Node e.g:
```JSON
{
  "uid": "_:diggy",
  "name": "diggy",
  "food": "pizza"
}
```

## Explicit UID

The correct way to write a new data or relation to an existing Node is by referencing its UID in Mutation. The Syntax is simple.

```
<THE-UID> # or 
<0x4e030f> <somePredicate> "some New data" .
```

One way of knowing which UID of an existing Node is to simply query for the indexed node. e.g:
```
{
  MyUser(func: eq(name, "Jack Torrance")) {
    uid
  }
}
```

{{% notice "note" %}}
Remember, you should only write the existing UID. If you write a mutation with an unallocated UID, Dgraph will return an error.
{{% /notice %}}
