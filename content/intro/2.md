Let's run an instance of Dgraph on your machine; that'll give you a
handle on installing Dgraph and loading data yourself.

All the data in this tutorial will be stored in the instance you
install and all the queries will look for Dgraph on your local machine.  By
running it in a container, you'll have a fresh Drgaph that will
serve as a sandbox for you to learn and experiment with.

There are a number of ways to
[install and run Dgraph](https://docs.dgraph.io/get-started/#step-1-installation).
For
this tutorial, let's run it in a container with Docker.

First, grab the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Then, pull the latest Dgraph version with:

```sh
docker pull dgraph/dgraph
```

Now, to run Dgraph in Docker, it's:

```sh
mkdir -p ~/dgraph

# Run dgraphzero
docker run -it -p 8080:8080 -p 9080:9080 -v ~/dgraph:/dgraph --name dgraph dgraph/dgraph dgraph zero

# In another terminal, now run dgraph
docker exec -it dgraph dgraph server --bindall=true --memory_mb 2048
```


That's it!

Dgraph will now be running and listening on port `8080`.
There are more options, but that's all we need to get started.
