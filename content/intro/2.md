Let's run an instance of Dgraph on your machine; that'll give you a
handle on installing Dgraph and loading data yourself.

All the data in this tutorial will be stored in the instance you
install, and all the queries will look for Dgraph on your local machine.
By running it in a container, you'll have a fresh Dgraph that will
serve as a sandbox for you to learn and experiment.

There are several ways to install and run Dgraph, all of which
you can find in the [Download page](https://dgraph.io/downloads).
For this tutorial, let's run Dgraph in a container with Docker.

First, grab the latest version of [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

Then, pull the latest Dgraph version with:

```
docker pull dgraph/dgraph:v20.03.0
```

Let's create a folder for storing Dgraph data outside of the container:

```
mkdir -p ~/dgraph
```

Now, to run Dgraph in Docker, it's:

```
# Run Dgraph zero
docker run -it -p 5080:5080 -p 6080:6080 -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 9080:9080 -p 8000:8000 -v ~/dgraph:/dgraph --name dgraph \
  dgraph/dgraph:v20.03.0 dgraph zero

# In another terminal, now run Dgraph alpha
docker exec -it dgraph dgraph alpha --lru_mb 2048 --zero localhost:5080 --whitelist 0.0.0.0/0

# And in another, run ratel (Dgraph UI)
docker exec -it dgraph dgraph-ratel
```


That's it!

Dgraph Alpha will now be running and listening for HTTP requests on port `8080` and Ratel would be listening on port `8000`.
There are more options, but that's all we need to get started.
