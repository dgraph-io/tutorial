Congratulations on completing the GraphQL tutorial portion of the Dgraph Tour!

You should now be able to load a schema into Dgraph's GraphQL API and perform
basic queries and mutations on it.

#### Where to go from here

- Follow the
  [Build a Message Board App in React](https://dgraph.io/learn/courses/messageboardapp/react/overview/introduction/)
  course to put into application what you have learned.
- You can find more in-depth details in Dgraph's
  [GraphQL API Documentation](https://dgraph.io/docs/query-language/).
- See [Deploy and Manage Documentation](https://dgraph.io/docs/deploy) to learn
  how you can run Dgraph in your own environment.
- Take [Dgraph's DQL Tour](https://dgraph.io/tour/intro/1/) to learn
  Dgraph Query Language (DQL), which runs underneath the GraphQL API of Dgraph.
