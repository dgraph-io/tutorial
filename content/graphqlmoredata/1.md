OK, we are off to a start with Dgraph and GraphQL. Let's move it up a few
notches.

Dgraph can also do query aggregation, geo-queries, string querying and more. But
for all that let's move from the small datasets we started with and try out
something bigger, much bigger.

In our GitHub repository you'll find a
[dataset about movies, directors and actors](https://github.com/dgraph-io/tutorial/tree/master/resources/1million.rdf.gz).

There's around one million triples in the dataset.

You could load this dataset into your Dgraph Cloud backend using Live Loader,
but that will eat up resources and exceed data transfer limits on the Free tier.

It's a big database of movies, but it won't trouble Dgraph. It is however, big
enough to see complex query results.

This dataset is one million triple subset of a
[larger dataset of movies](https://github.com/dgraph-io/benchmarks/blob/master/data/21million.rdf.gz)
that contains around 230000 actors and around 86000 movies.

To demonstrate a bigger dataset, without data transfer limitations, we have
loaded a movie dataset into a playground and applied the schema displayed here
to generate the GraphQL API. In this dataset we have 275,195 films and 63,450
persons appearing in the films. This is not meant for a complete or accurate
movie dataset, so you may find that your favorite movies or actors may be
missing.
